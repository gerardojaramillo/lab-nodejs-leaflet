Cool, you have a copy !

## Docker is required

Works well with Docker version 28 or major

if you want it to run locally in docker, just type and execute the command below

```
docker compose up -d
```

then 

Open a browser and type http://localhost:8080/

Ualá ! a basic geojson map ! but with a lot of potential.
