# lab-nodejs-leaflet 

## GitHub

```
git clone git@github.com:gerardojaramillo/lab-nodejs-leaflet.git
```

Cool, you have a copy !

## Docker is required

Works well with Docker 28 version or major

if you want it to run locally in docker, go to the folder lab-nodejs-leaflet, type and execute the command below

```
docker compose up -d
```

after a few seconds the image is created, open browser and type http://localhost:8080/

Ualá ! a basic geojson map ! but with a lot of potential.
